## [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin for compatible smart bed platforms
Copyright Â© 2024 hbblebc. All rights reserved.

This repository contains a smart bed control plugin for homebridge that allows you to control various features of your supported beds. For example, sleep number setting (modeled as a lightbulb), head/foot position, outlets, foot warming, massage, etc. It will detect all the beds on your account and add them automatically.

### Supported bed platforms
 - sleep number

# Installation

Install through homebridge-config-ui-x.

# Configuration

Configure in Homebridge UI following config.schema.json

# Usage

The platform supports the following HomeKit devices:

- Inflation numbers and head/foot positions are modeled as a lightbulb in HomeKit. 
  - This allows you to set the value easily. Keep this in mind when telling Siri to turn off all the lights. 
- Occupancy of the bed is a standard occupancy sensor
- Outlets and lights are homekit outlets
- Privacy mode and Responsive Air mode are homekit switches
- Foot warming is modeled as a thermostat (This is a little odd but easy to learn)
  - The thermostat has 4 modes that map to the following temperature controls:
    - Off -> Off
    - Auto -> Low
    - Cool -> Medium
    - Heat -> High
  - The temperature slider for the thermostat allows you to control the foot warming timer. It only has a range of 50-100, so if you want to set the foot warming timer to a different value, you will need to use the bed app, or create an automation to to set the temperature every X minutes. 

All the controls for a single bed will be grouped inside of a single device matching the name of the bed. If you would rather have separate controls, the HomeKit app will let you split the device into separate controls

### Privacy Mode

When privacy mode is enabled, the API requests that provide occupancy status will be non-functional. As a result, when privacy mode is enabled for a bed, polling will be disabled and occupancy sensors will be unresponsive. If you plan on keeping privacy mode enabled permenantly, I recommend keeping polling disabled and hiding the occupancy sensor devices from the accessory list using the platform settings.

# Issues/Future Work

None for now
